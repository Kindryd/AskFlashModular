# üîß AI Prompt Optimization & Conversation Context Fix

**Date**: 2025-01-28  
**Issues Addressed**: 
1. AI stops referencing documentation correctly in longer conversations (10+ messages)
2. Verbose, emoji-heavy prompts waste tokens and processing power  
**Status**: ‚úÖ RESOLVED  

## üîç Problem Analysis

### **1. Conversation Context Management Issue**
In longer conversations (~10 messages deep), the AI exhibited degraded documentation referencing behavior due to context window dilution.

### **2. Inefficient Prompt Design Issue**
The system was using human-oriented conversational language with emojis and verbose explanations in AI prompts, which is inefficient:

```python
# BEFORE: Verbose, emoji-heavy prompt (wasteful)
prompt = """üî• CRITICAL PRIORITY SYSTEM: 

**DOCUMENTATION CONTEXT IS ALWAYS KING**: When provided with Context...
‚úÖ **ALWAYS**: Start by examining the PROVIDED CONTEXT thoroughly
‚ùå **NEVER**: Assume previous responses are more accurate..."""

# AFTER: Optimized AI instruction (efficient)  
prompt = """SYSTEM: AI assistant for Flash Group with internal documentation access.

INFORMATION PRIORITY (STRICT):
1. PROVIDED CONTEXT - Primary authoritative source
2. CURRENT QUERY - User's immediate request
3. CONVERSATION HISTORY - Intent understanding only
4. GENERAL KNOWLEDGE - Supplement only, never override"""
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Solutions Implemented

### **A. Conversation Context Management**

**1. Intelligent History Truncation**
- Limited conversation context to 3000 characters maximum
- Preserve 4 exchanges maximum to prioritize documentation context
- Smart extraction of key information from long AI responses

**2. Enhanced System Prompts**
- Explicit prioritization of fresh documentation over conversation history
- Special handling for extended conversations (3+ exchanges)
- Clear instructions about Context vs. conversation history priority

**3. Key Information Extraction**
```python
def _extract_key_response_info(self, response: str, original_query: str) -> str:
    """Extract key information from previous responses without overwhelming context"""
    # Keep first 2 sentences + important terms (emails, team names)
    # Limit to 300 characters maximum
```

### **B. AI Prompt Optimization**

**1. System Prompt Streamlining**
- Removed all emoji usage from system prompts
- Eliminated conversational language ("You are a helpful..." ‚Üí "SYSTEM:")
- Replaced verbose explanations with concise, direct instructions
- Used structured protocols instead of narrative descriptions

**2. Logging Optimization** 
- Cleaned up 50+ emoji logging statements across codebase
- Changed `logger.critical()` with emojis to appropriate log levels
- Reduced log verbosity while maintaining essential debugging info

**3. Response Generation Optimization**
- Streamlined reasoning step messages
- Removed redundant explanatory text in streaming responses
- Optimized context preparation methods

## üìä Technical Implementation Details

### **Enhanced Conversation History Management**
```python
async def _get_conversation_history(self, conversation_id: str, limit: int = 5) -> List[Dict]:
    # Get more records to intelligently select from
    result = await self.db.execute(
        select(SearchHistory)
        .where(SearchHistory.conversation_id == conversation_id)
        .order_by(SearchHistory.created_at.desc())
        .limit(limit * 2)  # Intelligent selection pool
    )
    
    # Adaptive truncation with context preservation
    max_context_length = 3000  # Preserve doc context
    for h in reversed(history):
        # Smart truncation for company mode responses
        if h.mode == "company" and len(assistant_content) > 200:
            assistant_content = self._extract_key_response_info(assistant_content, h.query)
```

### **Optimized System Prompt Structure**
```python
def _build_system_prompt(self, mode: str, ruleset: Ruleset) -> str:
    if mode == "company":
        prompt = f"""SYSTEM: AI assistant for Flash Group with access to internal documentation and general knowledge.

INFORMATION PRIORITY (STRICT):
1. PROVIDED CONTEXT - Primary authoritative source
2. CURRENT QUERY - User's immediate request  
3. CONVERSATION HISTORY - Intent understanding only
4. GENERAL KNOWLEDGE - Supplement only, never override

CONTEXT PROCESSING RULES:
- Always examine provided Context first before using conversation history
- Extract all relevant data from Context including names, roles, emails, procedures
- If Context contradicts previous responses, Context takes precedence
- In extended conversations, refresh knowledge from current Context, not previous responses"""
```

### **Cleaned Logging System**
```python
# BEFORE: Emoji-heavy, verbose logging
logger.critical(f"üö® AISERVICE.PROCESS_QUERY CALLED - query: '{query[:30]}...', mode: {mode}")
logger.critical(f"üîç Documentation search returned {len(docs)} results")
logger.info(f"‚úÖ Added doc {i+1}, total context length: {current_length}")

# AFTER: Clean, efficient logging  
logger.info(f"AISERVICE.PROCESS_QUERY CALLED - query: '{query[:30]}...', mode: {mode}")
logger.info(f"Documentation search returned {len(docs)} results")
logger.debug(f"Added doc {i+1}, total context length: {current_length}")
```
