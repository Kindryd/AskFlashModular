# Streaming Data Parsing Fix - 2025-06-10

## Issue Description
Users experiencing "Failed to parse streaming data" errors when the AI attempts to produce responses with documentation context in company mode. This was preventing the conversation system from working properly.

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **JSON Chunking Issue**: Network chunking was splitting JSON objects across multiple chunks, causing frontend parsing failures
2. **Complex Object Serialization**: Backend was attempting to serialize complex Azure DevOps objects that could exceed JSON limits
3. **Unicode Handling**: Some documentation content contained characters that weren't properly handled during JSON serialization

## Solution Implemented

### Frontend Improvements (`frontend/src/Chat.js`)
- **Enhanced Buffering**: Added buffer management to handle incomplete JSON chunks from network streaming
- **Better Error Reporting**: Improved error logging to identify specific parsing issues
- **Graceful Degradation**: Skip malformed chunks gracefully while waiting for complete data

### Backend Improvements (`backend/app/services/streaming_ai.py`)
- **Robust JSON Serialization**: Enhanced `_safe_json_dumps()` method with:
  - Size limits for complex objects (5000 character limit)
  - Fallback error handling for problematic objects
  - JSON validation before sending to frontend
- **Source Filtering**: Added validation to ensure all source objects are JSON serializable
- **Minimal Fallback Sources**: Create safe minimal source objects when serialization fails

## Technical Details

### Frontend Buffer Management
```javascript
let buffer = ''; // Buffer for incomplete JSON chunks
// Split by newlines but keep incomplete lines in buffer
const lines = buffer.split('\n');
buffer = lines.pop() || ''; // Keep the last incomplete line in buffer
```

### Backend JSON Safety
```python
# Additional safety check - ensure the JSON is valid by parsing it back
json_str = json.dumps(obj, default=json_serializer, ensure_ascii=False, separators=(',', ':'))
json.loads(json_str)  # Validate JSON before sending
return json_str
```

## Expected Results
- Elimination of "Failed to parse streaming data" errors
- Smooth streaming responses in company mode
- Better error reporting when issues do occur
- Graceful handling of complex documentation sources

## Files Modified
- `frontend/src/Chat.js` - Enhanced streaming parser with buffering
- `backend/app/services/streaming_ai.py` - Improved JSON serialization safety

## Status
âœ… **Implemented** - Ready for testing
