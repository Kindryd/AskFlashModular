# Documentation Architecture Restructure

**Date**: 2025-01-28  
**Type**: Documentation Improvement  
**Impact**: Development Efficiency Enhancement  

## Summary
Restructured project documentation to improve AI context efficiency and eliminate changelog bloat that was hampering development effectiveness.

## Changes Made

### Documentation Structure Redesigned
- **@ask-flash.mdc**: Mini rules set for prompt-by-prompt AI adherence (high-level instructions)
- **@askflash-codebase.mdc**: AI-specific technical context (codebase structure, patterns, conventions)
- **@ARCHITECTURE.md**: High-level architecture for users and AI (vision, system design, index)

### New Changelog System
- Created `docs/changelogs/` directory with standardized naming: `YYYY-MM-DD_feature-name.md`
- Extracted historical changes to individual changelog files:
  - `2025-01-28_dual-ai-architecture.md`
  - `2025-06-03_source-url-migration.md`
  - `2025-01-28_conversation-context-fix.md`
  - `2025-01-28_documentation-restructure.md`

### Files Restructured

#### askflash-codebase.mdc (24KB → 7KB)
- **Removed**: Conversational elements, emoji-heavy changelog content, temporary information
- **Focused**: Concise technical context for AI development
- **Added**: Clear architecture patterns, service layer descriptions, naming conventions
- **Improved**: Cross-referenced actual project structure

#### ARCHITECTURE.md (31KB → 20KB)
- **Removed**: Detailed changelog sections, implementation-specific fixes
- **Focused**: High-level system architecture, design patterns, future roadmap
- **Enhanced**: Clean architecture diagrams, deployment strategies, monitoring approaches
- **Preserved**: Technical foundation and scalability considerations

## Problems Solved
- **AI Context Efficiency**: Removed 40%+ bloat from documentation files
- **Information Architecture**: Clear separation of concerns between different doc types
- **Maintainability**: Changelog system prevents future documentation bloat
- **Developer Experience**: Faster onboarding with focused, relevant context

## Impact
- ✅ Improved AI development efficiency with focused context
- ✅ Cleaner documentation structure for long-term maintenance
- ✅ Standardized changelog system for tracking changes
- ✅ Better separation between user-facing and AI-specific documentation
