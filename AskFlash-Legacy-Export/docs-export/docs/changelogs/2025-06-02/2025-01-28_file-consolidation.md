# File Consolidation - Duplicate askflash-codebase.mdc

**Date**: 2025-01-28  
**Type**: Bug Fix  
**Impact**: Documentation Cleanup  

## Summary
Fixed duplicate askflash-codebase.mdc files by consolidating to the correct location in `.cursor/rules/` and removing the outdated version from project root.

## Problem Identified
- Two identical filenames: `askflash-codebase.mdc` in both project root and `.cursor/rules/`
- The `.cursor/rules/` version was outdated with old organizational structure and bloat
- The root version contained the clean, updated content from our restructuring

## Changes Made

### File Consolidation
- **Updated**: `.cursor/rules/askflash-codebase.mdc` with clean, current content
- **Removed**: Duplicate `askflash-codebase.mdc` from project root

### Content Applied
- Concise technical context for AI development
- Updated project structure reflecting new `scripts/` and `docs/` organization
- Current service architecture (dual-AI, Intent AI, etc.)
- Clean naming conventions and development standards
- Removed conversational elements and changelog bloat

## Technical Details
- File size: Reduced from ~12KB (old version) to ~7KB (clean version)
- Structure: Properly reflects current project architecture
- Location: Now correctly placed in `.cursor/rules/` for AI context

## Impact
- ✅ Eliminated file duplication and confusion
- ✅ Ensured AI has access to correct, current codebase context
- ✅ Maintained proper file organization standards
- ✅ Consistent with our documentation restructuring goals
