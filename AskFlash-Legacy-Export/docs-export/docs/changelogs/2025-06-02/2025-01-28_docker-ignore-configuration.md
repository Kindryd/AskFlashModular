# Docker Ignore Configuration

**Date**: 2025-01-28  
**Type**: Build Optimization  
**Impact**: Container Size Reduction  

## Summary
Configured Docker builds to exclude documentation and development files while ensuring they remain tracked in git version control.

## Changes Made

### Root .dockerignore Updated
Added exclusions for development files not needed in production containers:
```
# Documentation and development files (not needed in production containers)
docs/
.cursor/
scripts/
```

### Backend .dockerignore Updated
Added relative path exclusions from backend build context:
```
# Documentation and development files (not needed in production containers)
../docs/
../.cursor/
../scripts/
```

## Files Excluded from Docker Builds

### Documentation Folders
- `docs/changelogs/` - Version change tracking
- `docs/planning/` - Feature guides and planning documents
- `docs/README/` - User-facing documentation
- `.cursor/rules/` - AI context and rules files

### Development Files
- `scripts/` - Test scripts and utilities
- Development artifacts not needed in production

## Git Tracking Confirmed
- ✅ `.gitignore` does NOT exclude `docs/` or `.cursor/` folders
- ✅ All documentation and development files are properly tracked in version control
- ✅ Git correctly shows all new folder structures as tracked files

## Benefits
- **Smaller Container Images**: Documentation and development files excluded from production builds
- **Faster Build Times**: Reduced build context size
- **Version Control Preserved**: All files remain tracked in git for collaboration
- **Security**: Development tools and documentation not present in production containers

## Impact
- ✅ Reduced Docker image size by excluding ~20KB+ of documentation
- ✅ Maintained proper version control for all project files
- ✅ Optimized build performance without losing development context
- ✅ Production containers only contain necessary runtime files
