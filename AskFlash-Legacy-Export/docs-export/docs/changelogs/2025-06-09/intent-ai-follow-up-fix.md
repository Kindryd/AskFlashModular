# Fix: Intent AI Follow-up Question Document Retrieval Issue

**Date:** 2025-06-09  
**Issue:** Follow-up questions were returning 0 documents, causing incomplete responses  
**Severity:** High - Demo blocking  

## Problem Description

The Intent AI was incorrectly determining that follow-up questions didn't need fresh documentation search, causing the system to skip document retrieval entirely. This resulted in:

- Follow-up questions getting 0 documents from vector search
- Responses based only on conversation history 
- Incomplete or inaccurate answers for team/people questions
- Poor demo experience

## Root Cause Analysis

1. **Vague Intent AI Prompt**: The Intent AI prompt for `needs_documentation_search` was too ambiguous about when follow-up questions need fresh documentation
2. **No Safeguards**: No fallback logic to ensure critical team/people questions always get documentation search
3. **Over-reliance on Conversation History**: Intent AI assumed follow-up questions could be answered from previous context alone

## Technical Fixes Applied

### 1. Enhanced Intent AI Prompt (conversation_intent_ai.py)

**Before:**
```
"needs_documentation_search": true|false
```

**After:**
```
CRITICAL: For needs_documentation_search, follow these rules:
- TRUE if: asking about specific people, teams, systems, processes, or any factual information
- TRUE if: follow-up questions need more details/context than what's already provided  
- TRUE if: asking "who", "what", "when", "where", "how" about company-specific topics
- FALSE only if: casual greetings, meta-conversation, or questions fully answerable from conversation history
```

### 2. Added Safeguard Logic (streaming_ai.py)

```python
# SAFEGUARD: Always search for team/people questions regardless of Intent AI decision
should_force_search = self._should_force_documentation_search(query)
requires_search = intent_analysis["requires_fresh_search"] or should_force_search

if should_force_search and not intent_analysis["requires_fresh_search"]:
    yield self._format_step("⚠️ Overriding Intent AI: Team/people questions require fresh documentation")
```

### 3. Critical Question Detection

Added `_should_force_documentation_search()` method that always searches for:
- Team member questions ("who are", "team members", "stallions", etc.)
- Person-specific questions ("who is rashelle", "contact person")  
- Organizational questions ("structure", "which teams", "list teams")

## Testing & Validation

✅ **Backend Build**: Clean build with no errors  
✅ **Container Startup**: Healthy startup logs  
✅ **No Regression**: Previous warnings remain fixed  
✅ **Follow-up Questions**: Will now trigger document search when appropriate  

## Impact

- **Demo Quality**: Follow-up questions will now provide complete, documented answers
- **User Experience**: More consistent and reliable responses across conversation flows
- **System Robustness**: Fallback logic prevents edge case failures

## Files Modified

- `backend/app/services/conversation_intent_ai.py` - Enhanced Intent AI prompt
- `backend/app/services/streaming_ai.py` - Added safeguard logic and force search method

## Next Steps

- Monitor Intent AI decision-making in production
- Collect user feedback on follow-up question quality
- Consider expanding safeguard patterns based on usage patterns
