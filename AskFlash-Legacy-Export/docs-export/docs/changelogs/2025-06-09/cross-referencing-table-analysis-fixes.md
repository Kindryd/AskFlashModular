# Cross-Referencing & Table Analysis Fixes

**Date:** 2024-12-27  
**Priority:** Critical  
**Type:** Intelligence Enhancement + Bug Fixes

## Issue Identified

**Problem:** AI was failing to cross-reference information across sources and couldn't recognize table structures, despite having access to the exact data needed.

**Specific Example:**
- User asked: "What teams are they responsible for?"
- Logs showed: 12 sources found including "Teams" page
- Teams page contained table: `Dev Team | Primary SRE | Dev Manager | Tech Ops`
- AI response: "The documentation provided does not specify the exact teams..."
- **Root Cause:** AI wasn't analyzing table structures or cross-referencing data

## Root Cause Analysis

### 1. **Content Processing Issues**
- `_build_context` only looked for bullet-point lists, not table structures
- Table indicators like `|`, `Dev Team`, `Primary SRE` weren't recognized
- 50-line truncation often cut off complete tables
- No logic to preserve markdown table structures

### 2. **Cross-Referencing Gaps**
- AI system prompt didn't emphasize synthesizing information across sources
- No specific instructions for analyzing structured data
- Missing guidance on connecting team members to team responsibilities

### 3. **Context Window Limitations**
- 6000-character context window insufficient for multiple table structures
- Truncation happening before complete organizational data included

## Technical Fixes Applied

### `backend/app/services/ai.py` - Enhanced Content Processing

#### Table Structure Recognition
```python
# BEFORE: Only looked for simple team indicators
team_indicators = ['team members', 'sre', 'devops', 'infrastructure', 'developers', 'engineers']

# AFTER: Enhanced with table-specific indicators
team_indicators = [
    'team members', 'sre', 'devops', 'infrastructure', 'developers', 'engineers',
    'dev team', 'primary sre', 'development teams', 'associated sre', 'tech ops',
    'dev manager', 'team lead', 'responsible for', 'allocation'
]

# NEW: Table structure detection
table_indicators = ['|', 'dev team', 'primary sre', 'tech ops', 'dev manager']

is_table_line = (
    '|' in line or 
    any(indicator in line_lower for indicator in table_indicators) or
    (line.strip() and all(word in line_lower for word in ['team', 'sre']))
)
```

#### Improved Content Preservation
```python
# BEFORE: 50-line limit, basic truncation
content_text = '\n'.join(important_sections[:50])

# AFTER: 100-line limit, table-aware processing
content_text = '\n'.join(important_sections[:100])

# Context window increased from 6000 to 8000 characters
context_window = company_settings.get("context_window", 8000)
```

#### Table Context Inclusion
```python
# NEW: Include table headers and context
if is_table_line and i > 0:
    prev_line = lines[i-1]
    if prev_line.strip() and prev_line not in current_section:
        current_section.insert(-1, prev_line)
```

### `backend/app/services/streaming_ai.py` - Enhanced AI Instructions

#### Cross-Referencing Requirements
```python
CROSS-REFERENCING & SYNTHESIS REQUIREMENTS:
- **CRITICAL: Actively cross-reference information across ALL available sources**
- **Look for table structures, especially team-to-SRE mappings and organizational charts**
- **When sources contain tables (Dev Team | Primary SRE | etc.), extract and synthesize the relationships**
- **Do NOT stop at the first source - analyze ALL sources to build complete picture**
- **If one source shows team members and another shows team responsibilities, connect them**
- **Pay special attention to structured data like tables with columns for teams, roles, and responsibilities**

TABLE & STRUCTURED DATA ANALYSIS:
- **Recognize markdown tables with pipes (|) as authoritative organizational data**
- **Extract team-to-SRE mappings from tables like "Dev Team | Primary SRE | Dev Manager"**
- **Cross-reference team names across different sources to build comprehensive understanding**
- **When you see structured data, use it to answer relationship questions definitively**
```

## How It Works Now

### Enhanced Processing Flow
1. **Source Collection:** Documentation service finds all relevant sources (e.g., Teams page)
2. **Table Detection:** Content processor identifies table structures with `|` pipes and organizational headers
3. **Context Preservation:** Tables and related content preserved with increased limits (100 lines, 8000 chars)
4. **Cross-Reference Analysis:** AI specifically instructed to synthesize information across sources
5. **Structured Data Priority:** Tables treated as authoritative organizational data

### Table Structure Recognition
- **Markdown Tables:** Lines with `|` pipes recognized as table rows
- **Column Headers:** `Dev Team`, `Primary SRE`, `Tech Ops`, `Dev Manager` identified
- **Context Inclusion:** Table headers and surrounding explanatory text preserved
- **Relationship Mapping:** AI extracts team-to-SRE relationships from table structures

### Cross-Referencing Logic
- AI now explicitly told to analyze ALL sources, not stop at first match
- Structured data (tables) prioritized over unstructured text
- Team member lists cross-referenced with team responsibility tables
- Multiple sources synthesized for comprehensive organizational view

## Expected Improvements

1. **Table Recognition:** AI will now properly read and interpret organizational tables
2. **Team Relationship Mapping:** Questions like "What teams are they responsible for?" answered using table data
3. **Cross-Source Synthesis:** Information from multiple sources combined for complete picture
4. **Structured Data Priority:** Tables and charts treated as authoritative over narrative text
5. **No Information Loss:** Larger context windows prevent truncation of critical organizational data

## Testing Scenarios

1. **Team Responsibility Questions:** "What teams is [SRE] responsible for?"
2. **Organizational Structure:** "Who manages the [team name] team?"
3. **Cross-Reference Queries:** "List all teams and their SREs"
4. **Table Data Extraction:** Questions requiring synthesis of tabular organizational data
5. **Multi-Source Analysis:** Queries needing information from multiple documentation sources

## Files Modified

- `backend/app/services/ai.py` - Enhanced table recognition and content processing

## Impact Assessment

**Before:** AI would miss critical organizational data even when sources contained exact information in table format.

**After:** AI can recognize, extract, and synthesize table structures to provide definitive answers about team relationships and organizational structure.

This fix addresses the core issue where the AI was "not figuring out that on the Teams page it lists the teams they are with" by ensuring table structures are properly recognized and cross-referenced.
