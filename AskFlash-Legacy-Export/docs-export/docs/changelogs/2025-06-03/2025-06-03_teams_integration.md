- Health checks for configuration validation
- Error simulation and handling verification

## üìä Impact & Benefits

### Business Impact
- **Improved Accessibility**: AI assistance available directly in Teams workflow
- **Increased Adoption**: Reduced friction for accessing company AI assistant
- **Enhanced Productivity**: No need to switch between applications
- **Consistent Branding**: Flash identity maintained across all touchpoints

### Technical Benefits
- **Scalable Architecture**: Leverages existing Flash AI infrastructure
- **Enterprise Security**: Bot Framework authentication and validation

- **Monitoring & Debugging**: Comprehensive logging and health checks

## üîÑ Migration & Deployment

### Backwards Compatibility
- Existing web interface remains fully functional
- No changes to core AI services or chat API
- Shared conversation management between web and Teams interfaces

### Deployment Steps
1. Install Bot Framework dependencies
2. Configure environment variables for Teams credentials
3. Register bot in Azure Bot Service or Teams Developer Portal
4. Configure webhook URL pointing to Teams endpoint
5. Create and install Teams app package

## üîÆ Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
- **Voice Support**: Speech-to-text and text-to-speech integration
- **File Sharing**: Document upload and analysis capabilities

- **Response Size**: Large responses may be truncated in Teams format

### Workarounds
- Complex responses are formatted with proper text wrapping
